# Reconstruct_the_sample_surface_based_on_APT_data_and_quantify_the_surface_enrichment
MATLAB script for Atom Probe Tomography (APT) data of High-Entropy Alloys (HEA: Ir/Ru/Rh/Pt/Pd). It reconstructs the HEA surface from HEA atoms only, performs per-cell ranked layer peeling so you can view any layer on demand, and computes 1-nm enrichment with KDE curves. Everything is exportable to Excel and controllable from an interactive UI.
